# xkcd-Guitar-Hero

Made for the [xkcd Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/xkcdgamejam). Created in about 2 days.

Heavily recommended to play with a physical controller if you have one, though this game was developed entirely with a keyboard with Frets on Fire-style controls. Almost all assets were created in MSPaint as atonement for not making a game during the MSPaint game jam.

Special thanks to Corvette who lent his voice as the singer for Hedgeclipper.
